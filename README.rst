Integrates maps with user registration form 

Description:
===========

Mostly every user registration form has location fields, such as city, state, country etc. To provide better user experience,
this app has a map feature(google map initially) which can be added to the registration form. The map will have auto-suggest
and the user can use the auto-suggest box or directly put the map marker on his location. 

The map will give the required fields which will be saved along with other info.
